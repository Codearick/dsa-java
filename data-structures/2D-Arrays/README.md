# 2D Arrays - Practice Questions

This repository contains practice questions involving operations on 2D arrays in Java. Each question involves solving a problem related to matrix or array manipulations.

---

## **Questions**

### **Question 1: Count the Number of 7â€™s in a 2D Array**

Write a program that counts the number of occurrences of the number `7` in a given 2D array.

**Example:**
```java
Input: 
int[][] array = { 
    {4, 7, 8}, 
    {8, 8, 7} 
};

Output: 2
```

### **Question 2: Sum of Numbers in the Second Row**

Write a program to calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row of a 2D array.

**Example:**
```java
Input: 
int[][] nums = { 
    {1, 4, 9}, 
    {11, 4, 3}, 
    {2, 2, 3} 
};

Output: 18
```

### **Question 3: Transpose of a Matrix**

Write a program to find the **transpose** of a matrix. 

**What is Transpose?**

The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping the rows and columns. For example, the transpose of a 2x3 matrix would be:

**Original Matrix:**
```
a11    a12    a13
a21    a22    a23
```

**Transposed Matrix:**
```
a11    a21
a12    a22
a13    a23
```
