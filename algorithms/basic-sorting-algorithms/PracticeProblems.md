# Basic Sorting Algorithms - Practice Questions

This repository contains practice questions that involve implementing various sorting algorithms in **descending order**. Each question requires you to use a different sorting algorithm to sort a given array.

---

## **Question**

### Sort the following array in **DESCENDING order** using the following algorithms:

**Array Example:**
```java
[3, 6, 2, 1, 8, 7, 4, 5, 3, 1]
```

**Sorting Algorithms:**
1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Selection Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**
4. **Counting Sort**

---

## **Instructions**
1. Implement each sorting algorithm to sort the array in descending order.
2. You can use the provided example array for testing your solutions.
3. Solutions for each sorting algorithm can be found in the `solutions.md` file.
